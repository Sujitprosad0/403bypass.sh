403bypass.sh - A Powerful Tool for Bypassing 403 Forbidden Errors
This script helps to bypass 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, and 400 Bad Request errors commonly encountered while performing penetration testing and bug bounty hunting. It automates the process of fuzzing paths and HTTP headers to find hidden resources or bypass security mechanisms like WAFs and reverse proxies.

Features:
Path-based Bypass:

Automatically tests common path fuzzing techniques such as:

/admin, /admin/, /%2e/, /%252e/, /admin/..%00/, /./admin, /..;/admin, and more.

Checks multiple variations to bypass access restrictions on URLs.

Header-based Bypass:

Uses custom HTTP headers like X-Forwarded-For, X-Originating-IP, X-Remote-IP, X-Forwarded-Host, Referer, X-Original-URL, etc.

These headers can be manipulated to bypass IP restrictions, proxy checks, and WAF filtering.

Status Code Checking:

Identifies successful bypass attempts by checking for status codes like 200 OK, 301 Redirect, or 302 Redirect while looking for 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, and 400 Bad Request.

Logs the results and provides a clear overview of what worked.

Single Domain & URL List Support:

Supports both single domain testing and URL list-based testing.

Single domain test: bash 403bypass.sh -d https://target.com/secret

URL list test: bash 403bypass.sh --list urls.txt

Usage:
To test a single URL:
bash 403bypass.sh -d https://target.com/secret

To test multiple URLs from a list:
bash 403bypass.sh --list urls.txt

Why Use This Tool?
Bypass security restrictions on hidden endpoints or admin panels that are protected by reverse proxies, firewalls, or IP restrictions.

Automates the process of path fuzzing and header manipulation, saving time in bug hunting and penetration testing.

Boosts your bug bounty reports, potentially helping you escalate findings from lower bounties (P4, P5) to higher ones (P3, P2).
